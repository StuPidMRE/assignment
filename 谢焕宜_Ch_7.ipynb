We had never actually seen a study that showed that ImageNet happen to be exactly the right size, and that other datasets could not be developed which would provide useful insights.

The paper explains: \"While data augmentation consistently leads to improved generalization, the procedure is dataset-dependent, and thus requires the use of expert knowledge.\" For instance, it's common to flip images as part of data augmentation, but should you flip only horizontally, or also vertically? The answer is that it depends on your dataset. In addition, if flipping (for instance) doesn't provide enough data augmentation for you, you can't \"flip more.\" It's helpful to have data augmentation techniques where you can \"dial up\" or \"dial down\" the amount of change, to see what works best for you.\n",

And the model has to predict two labels per image, rather than just one, as well as figuring out how much each one is weighted. Overfitting seems less likely to be a problem, however, because we're not showing the same image in each epoch, but are instead showing a random combination of two images.\n",

        "Mixup requires far more epochs to train to get better accuracy, compared to other augmentation approaches we've seen. You can try training Imagenette with and without Mixup by using the *examples/train_imagenette.py* script in the [fastai repo](https://github.com/fastai/fastai). At the time of writing, the leaderboard in the [Imagenette repo](https://github.com/fastai/imagenette/) is showing that Mixup is used for all leading results for trainings of >80 epochs, and for fewer epochs Mixup is not being used. This is in line with our experience of using Mixup too.\n",

        "One of the reasons that Mixup is so exciting is that it can be applied to types of data other than photos.

        "\n",
        "There's another subtle issue that Mixup deals with for us, which is that it's not actually possible with the models we've seen before for our loss to ever be perfect. The problem is that our labels are 1s and 0s, but the outputs of softmax and sigmoid can never equal 1 or 0. This means training our model pushes our activations ever closer to those values, such that the more epochs we do, the more extreme our activations become.\n",

        "With Mixup we no longer have that problem, because our labels will only be exactly 1 or 0 if we happen to \"mix\" with another image of the same class.

That is to say, we're not *explicitly* telling our model that we want to change the labels in this way. So, if we want to make the labels closer to, or further away from 0 and 1, we have to change the amount of Mixup—which also changes the amount of data augmentation, which might not be what we want. There is, however, a way to handle this more directly, which is to use *label smoothing*."

        "Instead, we could replace all our 1s with a number a bit less than 1, and our 0s by a number a bit more than 0, and then train. This is called *label smoothing*. By encouraging your model to be less confident, label smoothing will make your training more robust, even if there is mislabeled data. The result will be a model that generalizes better.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is how label smoothing works in practice: we start with one-hot-encoded labels, then replace all 0s with $\\frac{\\epsilon}{N}$ (that's the Greek letter *epsilon*, which is what was used in the [paper that introduced label smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) and is used in the fastai code), where $N$ is the number of classes and $\\epsilon$ is a parameter (usually 0.1, which would mean we are 10% unsure of our labels). Since we want the labels to add up to 1, replace the 1 by $1-\\epsilon + \\frac{\\epsilon}{N}$. This way, we don't encourage the model to predict something overconfidently. In our Imagenette example where we have 10 classes, the targets become something like (here for a target that corresponds to the index 3):\n",

        "```\n",
        "In practice, we don't want to one-hot encode the labels, and fortunately we won't need to (the one-hot encoding is just good to explain what label smoothing is and visualize it)."

        "> : This maximum is not achievable for finite $z_k$ but is approached if $z_y\\gg z_k$ for all $k\\neq y$—that is, if the logit corresponding to the ground-truth label is much great than all other logits. This, however, can cause two problems. First, it may result in over-fitting: if the model learns to assign full probability to the ground-truth label for each training example, it is not guaranteed to generalize. Second, it encourages the differences between the largest logit and all others to become large, and this, combined with the bounded gradient $\\frac{\\partial\\ell}{\\partial z_k}$, reduces the ability of the model to adapt. Intuitively, this happens because the model becomes too confident about its predictions."

        "Let's practice our paper-reading skills to try to interpret this. \"This maximum\" is refering to the previous part of the paragraph, which talked about the fact that 1 is the value of the label for the positive class. So it's not possible for any value (except infinity) to result in 1 after sigmoid or softmax. In a paper, you won't normally see \"any value\" written; instead it will get a symbol, which in this case is $z_k$. This shorthand is helpful in a paper, because it can be referred to again later and the reader will know what value is being discussed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then it says \"if $z_y\\gg z_k$ for all $k\\neq y$.\" In this case, the paper immediately follows the math with an English description, which is handy because you can just read that. In the math, the $y$ is refering to the target ($y$ is defined earlier in the paper; sometimes it's hard to find where symbols are defined, but nearly all papers will define all their symbols somewhere), and $z_y$ is the activation corresponding to the target. So to get close to 1, this activation needs to be much higher than all the others for that prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, consider the statement \"if the model learns to assign full probability to the ground-truth label for each training example, it is not guaranteed to generalize.\" This is saying that making $z_y$ really big means we'll need large weights and large activations throughout our model. Large weights lead to \"bumpy\" functions, where a small change in input results in a big change to predictions. This is really bad for generalization, because it means just one pixel changing a bit could change our prediction entirely!\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we have \"it encourages the differences between the largest logit and all others to become large, and this, combined with the bounded gradient $\\frac{\\partial\\ell}{\\partial z_k}$, reduces the ability of the model to adapt.\" The gradient of cross-entropy, remember, is basically `output - target`. Both `output` and `target` are between 0 and 1, so the difference is between `-1` and `1`, which is why the paper says the gradient is \"bounded\" (it can't be infinite). Therefore our SGD steps are bounded too. \"Reduces the ability of the model to adapt\" means that it is hard for it to be updated in a transfer learning setting. This follows because the difference in loss due to incorrect predictions is unbounded, but we can only take a limited step each time."
